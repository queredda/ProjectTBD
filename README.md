# Description

The REST API is modelled as an online book store, in terms to show updated GRB database. The codes are refactored

This API application is used for the Good Reading Bookstore. Since each file has a distinct role, the codes are reorganised into separate files. The queries.js file houses the queries used to interact with the PostgreSQL database, the routes.js file contains the endpoint routes, and the controller.js file contains the business logic for the API. The Pool connection to PostgreSQL, where the database credentials are stored in the.env file, is stored in the db.js file. The back end is accessed through the server.js file.
